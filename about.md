I'm a digital/online programmatic advertising technology specialist focused on the development of technologies that meet the needs of today's large publishers. I've spent over 15 years helping European publishers apply technology to help manage online advertising & understand that, as the market evolves, publishers must continually have new tools and greater insight to manage their ad business effectively. Today's premium publishers have to contend with established and emerging media platforms and are looking for technology that helps them easily manage the sophisticated advertising requirements of their customers across multiple channels. I've a broad experience of digital advertising technologies from customer services and sales perspectives. Understanding of online advertising marketplace from both buy- and sell-side.
